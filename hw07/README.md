This was made with simple design choices. For managers, each user has a manager_id field that can be nulled. This way a user can find all the users they manage and so on. Task reports can be loaded with nested associations. The time blocks were added with a new table. Each timeblock has a task id to associate it. The front end was made simply by using ajax to make a start/stop button for time tracking. This creates time blocks. Once they are created, they can be edited/deleted for a given task from the task edit page.
